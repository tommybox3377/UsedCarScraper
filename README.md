# UsedCarScraper
program for collecting info on used cars
this program currently scrapes data from craigslist and given the make, model, and trims will serach for those model on every craiglist website in the US. It also defaults to put findings in a MySQL DB with the proper db and tables ("usedcars" db, containing 2 tables "all_cars" and "urlstoscrape") set up
Feel free to contact me for any questions as to how it works!
